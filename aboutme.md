I collaborate effectively with backend developers on APIs, with product managers on requirements, and with designers on UI/UX to deliver the best possible possible features in a timely manner.

Outside of software development, my interests include music, motorcycles, literature, snowboarding and travel. I'm always striving to improve myself, both in my professional and personal life.
