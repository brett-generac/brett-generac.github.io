Software engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and developing user interfaces.

I have an excellent grasp of computer science fundamentals and write semantic code according to industry best practices.

I collaborate effectively with backend developers on APIs, with product managers on requirements, and with designers on UI/UX to deliver the best possible possible features in a timely manner.

Outside of software development, my interests include music, motorcycles, bicycles, literature, snowboarding, geography, and travel.
