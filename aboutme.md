Sometimes I stand silly for photos, and I do my best to make work fun.

I collaborate effectively with backend developers on APIs, with product managers on requirements, with designers on UI/UX, and with SDETs on end-to-end testing, in order to deliver the best possible possible features in a timely manner.

Outside of software development, my interests include music, motorcycles, literature, snowboarding, and travel. I'm always striving to improve myself, both in my professional and personal life.
