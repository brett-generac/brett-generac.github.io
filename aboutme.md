Sometimes I stand weird in photos, and I do my best to make work fun.

I write descriptive, intuitive code, and design extensible, scalable, systems and data structures.

I collaborate effectively with backend devs on REST endpoint design, with product managers on requirements, with designers on UI/UX, and with SDETs on testing, in order to deliver the best possible features in a timely manner.

Outside of software development, my interests include music, motorcycles, literature, snowboarding, geography, nature, and travel. I'm always striving to improve myself, both in my professional and personal life.
