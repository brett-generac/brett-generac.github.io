Internal website used by GSI employees, a suite of tools for gathering and processing customer SEO data.

Vanilla JS used for reading and uploading files, and for gathering data from 3rd party APIs. Python used for the processing of data, in Flask and/or AWS Lambdas.

I was the sole frontend developer at the comoany, and I redesigned the entire site, took ownership of codebase by refactoring it, documenting it and ensuring quality.
