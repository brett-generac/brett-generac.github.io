Internal website used by GSI employees, a suite of tools for processing and gathering customer SEO data.

Vanilla JS used for reading and uploading files, and for gathering data from 3rd part APIs. Python used for the processing of data, in Flask and/or AWS Lambdas.

As the only frontend developer, I redesigned the entire site, took ownership of codebase and assured quality.
