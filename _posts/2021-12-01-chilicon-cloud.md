Legacy application inherited by Generac Clean Energy Systems from an acquisition, a monitoring platform for IoT device performance, Chilicon Power microinverters.

Django App in Docker Container network.

I improved this project's incredibly messy code base, both on the client side and server side. Also, restyled the UI and wrote documentation, which was previously nonexistent.
