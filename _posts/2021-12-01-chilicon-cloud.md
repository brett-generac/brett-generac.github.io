Legacy application inherited from an acquisition made by Generac Clean Energy Systems, a monitoring platform for IoT device (microinverter) performance and remote configuration.

Django app in Docker Container network.

I improved this project's incredibly messy code base, both on the client side and server side. Also, restyled the UI and wrote documentation, which was previously nonexistent.
