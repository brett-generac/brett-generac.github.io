Personal project, related to my hobby of songwriting - fully functional app that is the simplest solution on the web for gathering rhymes, synynoyms, and related words for one's working lyrics, all in one place. React TypeScript App consisting of a dynamic rich text editor that can query word data related to the inputted text. Uses the Datamuse API for fetching word data and slate.js for rich text editing.
