Project related to my hobby of songwriting, a fully functional app that is the simplest solution on the web for gathering rhymes, synynoyms, and related words for one's working lyrics, all in one place.

React-TypeScript app consisting of a dynamic rich text editor that can query word data related to the inputted text. Uses the Datamuse API for fetching word data, slate.js for rich text editing, and Material UI for components. Hosted with Netlify.

Here's the <a href="https://github.com/clockmakerbrett/lyricly" target="_4blank">repo</a>.

Here's the website, paste in your favorite song lyrics and find some other words that might work.
