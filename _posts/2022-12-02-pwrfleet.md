My main project while working for Generac Clean Energy Systems, a web app used for registering, monitoring and configuring IoT devices, primarily the Generac <a href="https://www.generac.com/all-products/clean-energy/pwrcell" target="_blank">PWRcell</a> inverter/battery system.

Mobile-friendly React-Typescript app that interfaces with a backend ecosystem of Spring Boot Microservices.

This product is for solar installation companies that sell our products. Here's a training <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dy-u11LYs" target="_blank">video</a> that explains a little more about it.

- Material UI for components and theme
- ChartJS for complex data visualizations
- Unleash for feature toggles/incremental rollout of features
- Storybook for designing and documenting components
- Jest for unit tests
- AWS Cognito for authentication
- AWS and Vercel for hosting
- CircleCI for builds

### Major Features & Tech Debt Initiatives That I've Delivered

Integrate with Salesforce API to provide our customers with the ability to create and view support tickets.

Complete re-write of IoT device performance charts using ChartJS, which included writing a custom plugin with the JS Canvas API, and a custom algorithm for achieving ideal axis behavior.

Replace clunky systems for making API calls and injecting response into the global state with RTK Query hooks, configure client-side caching and transformation of response data.

Design and implement a custom React hook to plug into charts for better handling of date ranges and timezones, and better determination of data granularity.
